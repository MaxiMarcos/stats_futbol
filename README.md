# Data about football

"This is a project that will have as its main functionality to manage data and statistics of football players.

It consists of two entities, 'teams' and 'player', which are related. When we create and load a team into the database, we will have the possibility to assign players existing in the other entity. Similarly, there are other options provided by the CRUD: Read, edit, and delete (teams and players)."
